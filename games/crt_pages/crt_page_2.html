    There is an enemy known as the <em>entity</em> that tracks and follows
    player around as they explore. The brain of the enemy AI is driven by a
    statemachine with the following states:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>IDLE</b>: Enemy sits still.</li>
    <li><b>CHASE</b>: Enemy actively chases after player.</li>
    <li>
      <b>TRACK</b>: When enemy just lost track of player, it tracks the player's
      last known locations.
    </li>
    <li><b>PATROL</b>: Enemy roams the map at random.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Originally, I planned for two more states. However due to the scope of the
    class <gray>and my ADHD</gray> they were not implemented.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>INTERCEPT</b>: Enemy attempts to pathfind a shortcut to intercept the
      player.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>NOISE TRACK</b>: Enemy tracks player using sound instead of line of
      sight.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Tracking</h4>

    <p>
      When the player leaves the active detection (line of sight + detection
      cone), the AI begins to
      <r>note down player position based on a set interval</r>. The player
      position gets pinged three times before tracking ends, and the enemy will
      proceed to pathfind to the three points in sequence. If the player is not
      found when reaching the end of track, the enemy goes back to patrol or
      idle.

    <h4>Vision</h4>

    <p>
      One more thing to mention is that the enemy operates on a vision cone that
      has a set range. Player is only detected within this range.
