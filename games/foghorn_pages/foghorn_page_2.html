  The level features a few distinctive areas (most are only blockouts). The
  starting area situates the player in a way that guides them through the use of
  elavation and landmarks. The extensive use of trees also provide safety.

<p>
  The horror effects are achieved through extensive use of custom textures,
  shaders, and custom blit passes.

<p>
  Lighting in the scene is set up in a way that compliments the custom fog
  effect (created in engine) anywhere you look. The name is <em>Fog</em>horn
  after all.

<h3>Lighthouse</h3>
<p>
  To ensure I have more in depth control of the behavior of the lighthouse, I've
  decided to create my own lighthouse model in Blender. It serves as a landmark
  in the level to guide the player, as well as reinforcing the central mystery.
</p>
<p>
  The lighthouse would give a false sense of safety if I play my cards right. It
  can behave unexpectedly at scripted moments to surprise the player.
