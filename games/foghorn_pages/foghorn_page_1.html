  The focus of this prototype is having an enemy AI that scans for the player.
  To lose them, break line of sight with the enemy for a short period of time.
</p>
<p>
  Foghorn plays with <em>raycasting</em>. Rays are used as line of sights for
  both the player and the enemy. The game fails if the player stays in the
  enemy's line of sight for too long. The core gameplay is about
  <inline style="color: var(--color-r)"
    >maintaining / breaking line of sight</inline
  >.
</p>
<p>
  To play into the theme of lighthouses and line of sights, the enemy has a
  unique design for its face. Its face light changes based on its state. The
  enemy has two states:
  <strong>scanning</strong> & <strong>following</strong>.

    While scanning, the enmey casts a ray from its eye-level. It will turn its
    head back and forth in a scanning motion, until the either

  <ul>
    <li>the enemy's ray detects the player</li>
    <li>the player's ray detects the enemy</li>

  <p>
    While following, the enmey always focuses its ray on the player while
    tracking the player's position. Its face light changes to white and slowly
    lerps to red as it gets closer to the player.
