  Ritual Night's narrative is created in collaboration with Art Director John.

  Death of the Moon:<br /><span style="font-size: smaller"

<p>
  To fully expand the lore and serve as a form of retention for the players, I
  wrote a <r>34-page-story</r> that both expands on existing lore and creates
  suspense for future updates.
</p>
<p>
  <r>The story is broken down into chapters that can be collected in-game.</r>

<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<div class="indent">
  <cap style="text-align: start"
    >I grew up in rural New England, a place where strange tales were
    commonplace. Stories of mysterious creatures, people vanishing near the sea,
    and whispered accounts of cult gatherings were as much a part of my
    childhood as the crashing waves. A part of me has always believed in these
    tales. I have seen the look of true terror in the eyes of fishermen
    recounting their stories. That same look now burned in the eyes of the man
    standing before me. And I couldn't look away.
