<h3>Our Design Process</h3>
<p>
  As a small core design team of 4, all of us participated in designing the core
  gameplay to some degree. Out of us 4, Mike (Creative Director) and I acted as
  the Lead Designers most of the time, and together, we created the following
  process that we have been using:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Ideation</b>
    <div class="indent">
      One of us would pitch something usually with a document or a deck.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Discussion</b>
    <div class="indent">
      Everyone sits down (or stands up when it gets exciting) in front of the
      whiteboard and talk about how the design fits into the existing game. This
      meeting is usually led by whoever brought up the idea.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Action items</b>
    <div class="indent">
      At the end of discussion, either Mike or I will breakdown everything in
      the meeting and into a comprehensible list of action items, and assign to
      relevant team members.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Implementation & Discord feedback</b>
    <div class="indent">
      Once whoever implementing or prototyping is done, they will create a
      thread in our discord with this structure that I templated:
      <ul>
        <li>What was done?</li>
        <li>Feedback questions</li>
        <li>Directed feedback questions (@’ing a specific team member)</li>
        <li>Further actions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Weekly playtest sessions</b>
    <div class="indent">
      We playtest our game every week regardless of whether or not there’s new
      content. This is usually followed by another quick discussion structured
      similar to the discord feedback where the designers ask specific questions
      to the testers.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Iterate, repeat, and polish</b>
    <div class="indent">
      Repeat all the steps above until we end up with something we are happy
      with. (Usually never, since everything gets iterated perpetually after
      every playtest…)
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorialization</h3>
<p>
  I was given full control of one of the major aspect of the game:
  Tutorialization.
</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>
  As a team entirely made of game design students, everyone has good ideas.
  Right from our first few playtests with the original prototype, we quickly
  realized the game is much more complicated than its usual competitors on the
  market. Thus tutorialization is crucial. We need to find the best way to
  progressively familiarize the players with Ritual Night.
</p>
<p>My goals for tutorialization is simple:</p>
<p class="indent">
  Get new players to a point where - they can start playing the game with some
  confusion, but not enough to cause frustration - as fast and entertaining as
  possible.
</p>
<p>To achieve this goal I came up with the following principals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to do? > What to do? (or… teach the buttons, not the strategies)</li>
  <li>Letting players do > Telling players what to do</li>
  <li>
    Do not feed too much information at once, break into digestible chunks
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>The Hurdle</h4>
<p>
  At first, I started with prototyping a full-on guided tutorial like many
  others. It was able to convey the core idea, however very quickly I became
  aware of its problem: it’s boring and it shoves too much important information
  in your too quickly.
</p>
<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>To fix it I separated the tutorialization into 2 parts:</p>
<div class="indent">
  <h4>Active</h4>
  <p>
    Active tutorials are there to teach the players the very basics by both
    directly explaining what they are, and immediately letting them practice it.
  </p>
  <h4>Passive</h4>
  <p>
    Players usually want to learn as they play. If they done it once in-game,
    it’s far more effective then explaining to them 10 times in isolation. Thus
    I put more effort into passive tutorials that players would get naturally as
    they play.
  </p>
  <p>
    These elements should not overshadow actual gameplay, it is ok for players
    to ignore them or turn them off, but still be present for those who need
    them.
