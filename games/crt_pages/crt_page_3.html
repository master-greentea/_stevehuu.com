<p>
  To re-create the 80s/90s retro computer feel, I added a console powered by
  ChaptGPT.
</p>
<p>
  This was achieved by using
  <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/faculty/21776-2/" target="_blank"
    >Eddy's</a
  >
  ChatGPT plugin that makes API calls to ChatGPT when provided with a token.
  Pretty straightforward and kinda brutforce. For more info on Eddy's plugin
  check out his game

  <h4>How it works</h4>
  <p>
    <s>Short answer is: black magic.</s> I made a custom scriptable that stores
    pre-written prompts. These information includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How should the console behave (personality traits)</li>
    <li>What languages to use</li>
    <li>What are the <r>concepts</r>*</li>
    <li>
      Which concepts can / should the player know about
      <b>at this stage</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A <r>concept</r> is a game-rule / mechanic phrased in in-game terminology.
    Concepts are stored in
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Databases</span> which are lists of
    strings with a name-description pair. The description is used to prompt
    ChatGPT to make sure it knows what the concepts are and what to say. The
    idea is that: based on player progress, they will unlock more concepts so
    that the console can tell them more lore / mechanics.

  <h4>Purpose?</h4>
  <p>
    <r
      >In my opinion, the best usage for LLMs in games is to make it an
      interactive in-game wiki.</r
    >
    If executed well it can revolutionize tutorialization and fragmented
    storytelling. It should
    <strong>serve as an addition on top of the core experience</strong> instead
    of putting it front and center as the core experience itself. (<gray
      >sorry Eddy</gray
    >)
  </p>
  <p>BUT! I hope someone proves me wrong. AI games are fun.</p>
  <p>
    At least at the time when I made this, LLMs are simply too difficult to
    control from a designer's standpoint. (<gray>maybe I'm just shit too</gray>)
    It's impossible to predict how will it behave once its in players' hands.
    That can become very annoying very quickly.<br />This is also why I opt for
    the Console to only be an assistant, but not to directly affect gameplay.

    <p>It's a console. It has to have some commands in some capacity.</p>
    <p>
      Commands are created making use of <r>UnityEvents</r>. Each command should
      be a scriptable object <gray>but I ran out of time to implement it</gray>.
      However they are still easy to create as arrays each with their designated
      enum. It's created this way so that I can easily utilize UnityEvents to
      have a clean and visually clear structure to implement and review all the
      functions that the command is calling.
