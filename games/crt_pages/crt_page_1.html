  The core gameplay is to emulate the experience of “play” an VHS tape on an old
  CRT. The player is lost in a monochrome maze while a scary monster chases you
  down. The camera angles are stiff and awkward, to balance it out the players
  get the power to control time itself. The game also features an AI powered
  smart console that the players can consult with. An <em>entity</em> living in
  CRT if you will.

  It has undergone two versions, one is the old yellow tone “<r>backrooms</r>”
  inspired look which I worked on at school; another is the updated stylized
  <r>monotone</r>
  version which was added after the class.

<h3>Time Manipulation</h3>
<p>
  Got bored during the semester and I made some time manipulation mechanics
  inspired by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFZrIAw1MzA" target="_blank">Jojo</a
  >. It fits the theme of watching old VHS on a CRT. <r>PAUSE</r> (time stop) is
  the most straightforward, but what if you can <r>REWIND</r> and
  <r>FAST FROWARD</r> too?
</p>
<br />
<div class="row indent">

    <h4>Rewind</h4>
    <div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative">
      <iframe
        src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1042966049?h=d3b231ef11&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write"
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%"
        title="rewind"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
    <p>To achieve rewind, I am storing the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>player position</li>
      <li>player camera direction</li>
      <li>enemy position</li>
      <li>enemy state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They are stored into a list each second. The list is
      <r>expandable based on how many seconds are allowed</r> to be rewinded. I
      had to limit the time units on the game to seconds since doing this
      per-frame is inconsistent and extremely not performative.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a cooldown to pervent spamming and also to avoid bugs if player
      time skips to <em>before</em> the game starts.

    <h4><s>Fast Forward</s> Skip</h4>
    <div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative">
      <iframe
        src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1042966114?h=c3918c5427&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"

    <p>^ <r>The skip happens at 00:06 in the video.</r></p>
    <p>
      Enemy now has a collider ball attached to the front of it. When that
      collider ball gets detected by a player raycast, it triggers a time skip.
      This creates the illusion when:
    </p>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>
        the enemy is about to enter player's view<br />-> skips time as if the
        enemy appeared out of nowhere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Coupled with changing the clock, it makes a pretty convincing the "<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpCPlnUlSaI"
        target="_blank"
        >King Crimson</a
      >" effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player's momentum is perserved and basically flashes forward in
      whichever direction they were going before.
