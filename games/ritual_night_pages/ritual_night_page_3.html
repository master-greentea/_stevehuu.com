<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>
  I was responsible for creating all of the in-game front-end UI elements. The
  process: I get cool mock-ups from our graphic designer. I re-create it
  responsively in Unity UI. I setup all the references and dependencies so that
  programmers have the right functions to call. I animate them. I localize all
  the texts. Then I pass it to the programmers.
</p>
<p>Here're some cool menus & animations.</p>

<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>
  I also created many helpful tools that helps our designers to speed up the
  implementation process.

  <h4>UI Building Blocks</h4>
  <p>
    I set up rules for our designers to follow, so that the entirety of Ritual
    Night's UI elements are responsive and built based on these following
    elements.
  </p>
  <img

  />
  <p>
    I also set up many handy UI tools such as the UIMotionController which is a
    custom animation controller to play specific UI animation clips, which
    vastly improves dev time.

  <h4>Cosmetic Tools</h4>
  <p>
    I made a tool using Unity's editor library and shader language so that the
    artists could quickly test, set up, and create cosmetic scriptables visually
    in the scene.

  <h4>Audio Tools</h4>
  <p>
    A sound tool is created too to expand on how sounds can be played in Unity.
    This was created by me to mimic functions in audio middlewares like Wwise.

  <h4>Localization Tools</h4>
  <p>
    Using I2 and our command plugin, I created a set of commands to quickly
    fetch updated localization from a hosted Google Sheet to collaborate with
    our publisher when QA'ing localization.
