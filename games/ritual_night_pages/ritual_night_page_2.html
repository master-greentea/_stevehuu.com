<p>
  With a small core team of 4, all of us participated in designing the main
  gameplay to some degree. Out of us 4, Mike (Creative Director) and I acted as
  the Lead Designers most of the time, and together, we created the following
  process that we have been using:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <r><b>Ideation</b></r
    >: One of us would pitch something
    <gray>(usually with a document or a deck)</gray>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <r><b>Discussion</b></r
    >: Everyone sits <gray>(or stands)</gray> in front of a whiteboard and talk
    about how the design fits into the existing game. This meeting is usually
    led by whoever brought up the idea.
  </li>
  <li>
    <r><b>Action items</b></r
    >: At the end of discussion, I breakdown everything into a comprehensible
    list of action items, and assign them to relevant team members.
  </li>
  <li>
    <r><b>Implementation & Discord feedback</b></r
    >: Once whoever implementing or prototyping is done, they will create a
    thread in our discord with a template structure:
    <div class="indent">
      <ul>
        <li>What was done?</li>
        <li>Feedback questions</li>
        <li>
          Directed feedback questions
          <gray>(@'ing a specific team member)</gray>
        </li>
        <li>Further actions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <r><b>Weekly playtest sessions</b></r
    >: We playtest our game every week regardless of whether or not there's new
    content. This is followed by another quick discussion similar to the discord
    feedback where the designers ask specific questions to testers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <r><b>Iterate, repeat, and polish</b></r
    >: Repeat all the steps above until we end up with something we are happy
    with <gray>(Usually never)</gray>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorialization</h3>
<img

  src="/images/games/ritual_night/design/tut_problem.jpg"
/>
<p>
  The problem with a team of game design student is that how do we teach our
  extravagantly over designed game to normal people. Thus tutorialization is
  crucial. We need to find the best way to progressively familiarize the players
  with Ritual Night.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Design Goal</h4>
<p>My goals for tutorialization is simple:</p>
<p class="indent">
  <r>
    Get new players into a game armed with as much info as they need to get
    started, as fast as possible.
  </r>
</p>
<p>I came up with the following principals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><r>How to do? > What to do?</r> (teach buttons, not strategies)</li>
  <li><r>Letting players do > Telling players what to do</r></li>
  <li>Do not overload information, break into digestible chunks</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h4>The Result</h4>
<p>I separated the tutorialization into 3 parts:</p>
<div class="indent">
  <hr />
  <h4>Active</h4>
  <p>
    Active tutorials are there to teach the players the basics by explaining
    what they are and immediately letting them practice it.

  <hr />
  <h4>Passive</h4>
  <p>
    <r
      >Players learn as they play. If they do it once in-game, it's far more
      effective then explaining to them 10 times in isolation.</r
    >
    Passive tutorials allow players to learn naturally as they play.
  </p>
  <p>
    <r>These elements should not overshadow actual gameplay.</r> It also isn't
    100% necessary information to get you started. I made sure players can
    easily choose to ignore them or turn them off.

  <h4>Written</h4>
  <p>
    There are also even more detailed written info about specific mechanics in
    the game present. These are designed for hardcore players who truly want to
    learn.
