          <p>Made a console powered by ChatGPT.</p>

            ChatGPT plugin that makes API calls to ChatGPT when provided with a

          <h4>How it works</h4>
          <p>
            Short answer is: its basically black magic.<br />I made a custom
            scriptable that takes in a bunch of pre-written information to
            prompt it. These information includes:
          </p>
          <li>how should the console behave</li>
          <li>what languages to use</li>
          <li>what concepts (slangs / terms made up for the game) there are</li>
          <li>what <em>can</em> the player know at this stage</li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Concepts are separated into
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Databases</span> which are
            just list of strings with the name of the concept and the prompt
            itself. The idea is based on the progress of the player, they will
            unlock more concepts so the console can tell them more stuff.
          </p>

          <h4>Purpose?</h4>
          <p>
            Honestly, I personally believe the best way to utilize language
            model is video game is for it to
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2 col-xl-4"></div>
            <div class="col-8 col-xl-4">
              <p>
                <strong
                  >serve as an addition on top of the core experience</strong
                >
                instead of putting it front and center as the core experience
                itself. (sorry eddy)
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-2 col-xl-4"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            BUT! I really want someone to prove me wrong though, because playing
            a AI powered game is sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least at the stage of this game's development, the language
            models are simply too difficult to control from a designer's
            standpoint. It's impossible to predict how it will behave once its
            in players' hands. That can become very annoying very quickly.<br />This
            is also why I opt for the Console to be a sort of assistant that
            fills in more lore of the game whenever it can, but not to directly
            affect gameplay.
          </p>

            type shit. Since the theme is centered around watching old VHS on a

                <br />
                Storing these info per second not per frame is due to

                There is a cooldown to pervent spamming and also to avoid bugs

                Enemy now has a collider ball attached to its front, but
                offsetted. When that collider gets detected by player raycast,
                it triggers a time skip.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Basically:</em><br />if (enemy is about to enter player
